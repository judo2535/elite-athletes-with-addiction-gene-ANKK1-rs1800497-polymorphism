Investigation of athletic performance and sports experiences of elite athletes with addiction gene (ANKK1/rs1800497) polymorphism
Objective: The present study aims to decipher any possible association of the ANKK1:NM 178510.2:c.2137G>A (rs1800497) polymorphism with the athletic performances/ personal best and sports experience of elite athletes. 
Methods: Sixty elite athletes (31 sprint/power and 29 endurance) and 20 control/sedentary with the ages of 18-35 voluntarily participated in the study. The performance levels of the personal best (PB) of the athletes was determined according to The International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) score. Whole exome sequencing (WES) was performed using the genomic DNA isolated from blood of the participants. The association between rs1800497 polymorphism and competitive performance and sports experience was examined by one-way analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) with the adjustment of age. Chi-square analysis was applied to test the fit (p<0.05) the difference between categorical variables.
Results: There were not any significant differences in genotype or allele distribution between the groups. Additionally, although no significant difference was found between the rs1800497 polymorphism and competitive performance (p>0.05), individuals with G>G genotype had higher PB scores than G>A. Importantly, the association of the rs1800497 polymorphism with sports experience was statistically significant (p<0.05).
Conclusion: When the literature and our results are evaluated together, genotype G>G could be linked to the both higher sports experience and higher athletic performance. Still, further studies are needed to clarify the mechanism underlying the association between this genotype and sports experience or athletic performance.
